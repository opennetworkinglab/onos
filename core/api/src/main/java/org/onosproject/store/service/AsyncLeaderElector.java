/**
 * Distributed mutual exclusion primitive.
 * <p>
 * {@code AsyncLeaderElector} facilitates mutually exclusive access to a shared resource by various cluster members.
 * Each resource is identified by a unique topic name and members register their desire to access the resource by
 * calling the {@link AsyncLeaderElector#run run} method. Access is grated on a FIFO basis. An instance can
 * unregister itself from the leadership election by calling {@link AsyncLeaderElector#withdraw withdraw} method.
 * If an instance currently holding the resource dies then the next instance waiting to be leader (in FIFO order)
 * will be automatically granted access to the resource.
 * <p>
 * One can register listeners to be notified when a leadership change occurs. The Listeners are notified via a
 * {@link Leadership} {@link Change change} subject.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, {@code AsyncLeaderElector} provides methods to query the current state of leadership for topics.
 * <p>
 * All methods of this interface return a {@link CompletableFuture future} immediately after a successful invocation.
 * The operation itself is executed asynchronous and the returned future will be
 * {@link CompletableFuture#complete completed} when the operation finishes.
