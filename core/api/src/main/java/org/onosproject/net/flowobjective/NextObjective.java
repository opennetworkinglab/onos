/**
 * Represents a nexthop which will be translated by a driver
 * into the appropriate group or actions needed to implement
 * the egress function.
 *
 * A next objective is made up of a collection of traffic treatments
 * associated with a type. These types are:
 *
 * - Hashed
 * - Broadcast
 * - Failover
 * - Simple
 *
 * These types will indicate to the driver what the intended behavior is.
 * For example, a broadcast next objective with a collection of output
 * treatments will indicate to a driver that all output actions are expected
 * to be executed simultaneously. The driver is then free to implement this
 * as a group or a simple action list.
