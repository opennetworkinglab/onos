# | Plea to Translators:                                                |
# | --------------------                                                |
# |   I know you are all keen to add your own language localization     |
# |   bundles for these files as soon as they appear in Gerrit reviews, |
# |   but please refrain from doing so immediately, until given the     |
# |   "green light"...                                                  |
# |                                                                     |
# |   The reason is, sometimes localization keys need to be renamed, or |
# |   strings moved to other bundles, while we work out how to localize |
# |   each UI component. If there are multiple files while a bundle is  |
# |   "in flux", it means modifications need to be done in 4-or-more    |
# |   places instead of just 1.                                         |
# |                                                                     |
# |   I promise I will mark a bundle as "ready for translation" as      |
# |   soon as the localization work has been completed for the default  |
# |   bundle, and the "dust has settled".                               |
# |                                                                     |
# |   Thank you in advance for your patience and restraint  :)          |
